# data-structures-p1


This C++ project implements Linear Abstract Data Types using wxWidgets to provide a graphical user interface (GUI). The application processes and visualizes Billboardâ€™s Number 1 Songs from the 1990s, demonstrating how these data structures handle and manipulate real-world data. This project was given to myself by Dr. John Charley at The University of The West Indies, in COMP2611 - Data Structures.
